# To Do List for 3D Model viewer
# In no particular order

- Initial checkin
  - stipped to the minimum
  - loads a model
  - Orbit control

- Use Query String Parameters to pass models and options to webpage

- Add Menu for changing options on the fly

- Enable STL viewing

- "Size" model
  - We want the model to be as large as possible within the viewing area

- Automatically center model
  - use the "box" method to figure out the "bottom" (along z) and raise it to z=0

- Automatically position camera based on model size and position

- Automatically size grid to model 
  - We want the model to look reasonably sized compared to the grid.
  - not to many squares per unit. we dont want the grid to obscure the model

- Display units on grid
  - mark each square of the grid?
  - maybe just a scale in the corner for sizing purposes? (ex. 1 grid square = 1cm)

- Display Axis
  - Label X/Y/Z

- Display grid for Z axis
  - Do we need a full grid like we have for X/Y?
  - Maybe just a line?

- Enable helper grid 
  - selectable through menu or through query string parameter
  
- Enable Gcode viewing

- Watermark display
  place a translucent object/image over window.

- Configurable light source
  - We had to add some light to make the model visible.
  - Would like the ability to adjust brightness
  - selectable through menu or through query string parameter

- optional automatic rotation
  - selectable through menu or through query string parameter

- message border
  - Similar to github message border on bottom of screen
  - selectable through menu or through query string parameter

- optional model info
  - selectable through menu or through query string parameter

- Optional shadow
  - selectable through menu or through query string parameter

- Optional perfomance statistics
  - selectable through menu or through query string parameter

- flip model
  - used to orient the model so it "lays" properly
  - selectable through menu or through query string parameter
