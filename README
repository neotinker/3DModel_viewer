This 3D model viewer began life as some example on the threejs website.

I do not consider this viewer *safe* so use at your own risk.

It is mostly based on the webgl_loader_amf.html example even though I implemented STL model support first. It had the general look I was going for.

3DModel_viewer.html currently only supports one parameter ("model"), which you can use to pass in a model to view. If you don't pass in a model parameter is will display the dust filter stl from the Mendel90 3D printer.

If you want to test a different model, pass the model url with the model parameter. The model URL must use "HTTP/HTTPS". You can't load model files from your local filesystem using "file:///" but you can load the 3DModel_viewer.html file using "file:///".

Here are the models I have been testing with:
3DModel_viewer.html?model=https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nophead/Mendel90/master/dibond_E3D/stls/dust_filter.stl
3DModel_viewer.html?model=https://threejs.org/examples/models/amf/rook.amf 
3DModel_viewer.html?model=https://threejs.org/examples/models/gcode/benchy.gcode
3DModel_viewer.html?model=https://threejs.org/examples/models/gltf/DamagedHelmet/glTF/DamagedHelmet.gltf

The viewer only supports stl, amf, gcode, and gltf models at the moment and possibly not well. :)

Currently supported query string parameters

- model
		Pass in a model URL to view

- zup
		Change orientation from standard Z is depth to Z is height.
