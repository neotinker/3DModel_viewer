This 3D model viewer began life as some example on the threejs website.

I do not consider this viewer *safe* so use at your own risk.

It is mostly based on the webgl_loader_amf.html example even though I implemented STL model support first. It had the general look I was going for.

3DModel_viewer.html currently only supports one parameter "model" which you can use to pass in a model to view. If you don't pass in a model parameter is will display the dust filter stl from the Mendel90 3D printer.

If you want to test a deferent model, such as the rook.amf from the threejs example models, pass the model url with the model parameter.

The viewer only supports stl and amf models at the moment and possibly not well. :)
